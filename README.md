rush is my implementation to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview). Of course, I decided to write my implementation in Rust.

In this challenge, I'll build my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo and more.
